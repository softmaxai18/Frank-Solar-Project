Types of Water Heaters
It's a good idea to know the different types of water heaters available before you purchase one:

- Conventional storage water heaters offer a ready reservoir (storage tank) of hot water which is adequate for everyday use. However, there are some instances, such as when more than one use for hot water is occurring or when there are guests in the home, increasing the requirements for hot water.

- Tankless or demand-type water heaters heat water directly without the use of a storage tank. This type of water heater is designed to provide an adequate supply of hot water without running out when adequately sized.

- Heat pump water heaters move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly for providing hot water, resulting in high efficiencies and significant cost savings.

- Solar water heaters use the sun's heat to provide hot water and also save money on energy bills.

- Tankless coil and indirect water heaters use a home's space heating system to heat water.
