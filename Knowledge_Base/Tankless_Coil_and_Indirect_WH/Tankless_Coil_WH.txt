A tankless coil water heater provides hot water on demand without a tank. When a hot water faucet is turned on, water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger installed in a main furnace or boiler. Tankless coil water heaters are most efficient during cold months when the heating system is used regularly but can be an inefficient choice for many homes, especially for those in warmer climates. Tankless systems are typically electric, oil, or gas-fired. These water heating systems work with forced air systems and hydronic or radiant floor heating systems.
