Proper installation and maintenance of a combination water and space heating system can optimize its energy efficiency.

Proper installation of your system depends on many factors. These factors include fuel type, climate, local building code requirements, and safety issues. Therefore, it's best to have a qualified plumbing and heating contractor handle the installation. Be sure to do the following when selecting a contractor:

Request cost estimates in writing
Ask for references
Check the company with your local Better Business Bureau
See if the company will obtain a local permit if necessary and understands local building codes, etc.
Periodic maintenance of your system can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Consult your installer and read your owner's manual for specific maintenance recommendations.
