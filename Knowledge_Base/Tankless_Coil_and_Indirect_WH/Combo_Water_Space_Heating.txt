Integrated or combination water and space heating systems usually cost more than a separate water heater and furnace or boiler, but installation and maintenance costs may be less. For example, you won't need multiple utility hook-ups since there's one source of heat. There also aren't as many moving parts to maintain or service. Some of these high efficiency systems may provide lower utility costs.

Most combination water and space heating systems are usually designed for new construction. However, there are some retrofit units available that can work with an existing water heater.

When selecting a system, you need to consider its size. The sizing of a combination system involves some different calculations than those used for sizing a separate water heating or space heating system. It's best left to a qualified plumbing and heating contractor.

To determine the energy efficiency of a combination water and space heating system, use its combined appliance efficiency rating (CAE). The higher the number, the more energy efficient. Combination appliance efficiency ratings vary from 0.59 to 0.90.
