A water heater's energy efficiency is determined by the uniform energy factor (UEF), which is based on how much energy the water heater uses and how much energy is used to power the water heater itself.  The higher the uniform energy factor, the more efficient the water heater.  

Estimates of a home water heater's energy efficiency and annual operating cost are shown on the yellow Energy Guide label.  You can then compare costs with other models. This will help you determine the dollar savings and payback period of investing in a more efficient model, which may have a higher purchase price.
