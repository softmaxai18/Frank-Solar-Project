A heat pump water heater utilizes a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. Heat is drawn (typically the ambient air using a fan) towards the evaporator coil, where a low-pressure refrigerant (commonly R-134a) would absorb the heat and evaporate. Then, a compressor would increase the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant vapor. This vapor would circulate through the condenser coil, which would be built into the tank or wrapped around a water tank, heating the water inside. The refrigerant would then pass through the expansion valve, lowering its pressure and temperature. 

Compared to the other technologies, heat pump water heaters are considered to have the highest energy efficiency as well as having low operating costs, providing long-term energy savings. However, it is less-effective in handling high-demand usage, suffers from a high upfront cost, and are not ideal for cold environments (losing efficiency in cold weather below 40Â°F)
