The proper installation of solar water heaters depends on many factors. These factors include solar resource, climate, local building code requirements, and safety issues; therefore, it's best to have a qualified solar thermal systems contractor install your system.

After installation, properly maintaining your system will keep i    t running smoothly. Passive systems don't require much maintenance. For active systems, discuss the maintenance requirements with your system provider, and consult the system's owner's manual. Plumbing and other conventional water heating components require the same maintenance as conventional systems. Glazing may need to be cleaned in dry climates where rainwater doesn't provide a natural rinse.

Regular maintenance on simple systems can be as infrequent as every 3–5 years, preferably by a solar contractor. Systems with electrical components usually require a replacement part or two after 10 years. Learn more about solar water heating system maintenance and repair.

When screening potential contractors for installation and/or maintenance, ask the following questions:

Does your company have experience installing and maintaining solar water heating systems?
Choose a company that has experience installing the type of system you want and servicing the applications you select.
How many years of experience does your company have with solar heating installation and maintenance?
The more experience the better. Request a list of past customers who can provide references.
Is your company licensed or certified?
Having a valid plumber's and/or solar contractor's license is required in some states. Contact your city and county for more information. Confirm licensing with your state's contractor licensing board. The licensing board can also tell you about any complaints against state-licensed contractors.

Passive solar water heating systems are typically less expensive than active systems, but they're usually not as efficient. However, passive systems can be more reliable and may last longer. There are two basic types of passive systems:

Integral collector-storage passive systems
These consist of a storage tank covered with a transparent material to allow the sun to heat the water.  Water from the tank then flows into the plumbing system. These work best in areas where temperatures rarely fall below freezing. They also work well in households with significant daytime and evening hot-water needs.
Thermosyphon systems
Water is heated in a collector on the roof and then flows through the plumbing system when a hot water faucet is opened. The majority of these systems have a 40 gallon capacity.  

--- /home/ritik/Documents/VScode/Softmaxai/Frank_Solar_Project/Knowledge_Base/Solar_Water_Heaters/Active_Solar_Water_Heating_Systems.txt ---
There are two types of active solar water heating systems:

Direct circulation systems
Pumps circulate household water through the collectors and into the home. They work well in climates where it rarely freezes.
Indirect circulation systems
Pumps circulate a non-freezing, heat-transfer fluid through the collectors and a heat exchanger. This heats the water that then flows into the home. They are popular in climates prone to freezing temperatures.

After your water heater is properly installed and maintained, try some additional energy-saving strategies to help lower your water heating bills, especially if you require a back-up system. Some energy-saving devices and systems are more cost-effective to install with the water heater.

--- /home/ritik/Documents/VScode/Softmaxai/Frank_Solar_Project/Knowledge_Base/Solar_Water_Heaters/Storage_Tanks_and_Solar_Collectors.txt ---
Most solar water heaters require a well-insulated storage tank. Solar storage tanks have an additional outlet and inlet connected to and from the collector. In two-tank systems, the solar water heater preheats water before it enters the conventional water heater. In one-tank systems, the back-up heater is combined with the solar storage in one tank.

Three types of solar collectors are used for residential applications:

Flat-plate collector
Glazed flat-plate collectors are insulated, weatherproofed boxes that contain a dark absorber plate under one or more glass or plastic (polymer) covers. Unglazed flat-plate collectors -- typically used for solar pool heating -- have a dark absorber plate, made of metal or polymer, without a cover or enclosure.
Integral collector-storage systems
Also known as ICS or batch systems, they feature one or more black tanks or tubes in an insulated, glazed box. Cold water first passes through the solar collector, which preheats the water. The water then continues on to the conventional backup water heater, providing a reliable source of hot water. They should be installed only in mild-freeze climates because the outdoor pipes could freeze in severe, cold weather.
Evacuated-tube solar collectors
They feature parallel rows of transparent glass tubes. Each tube contains a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. The fin's coating absorbs solar energy but inhibits radiative heat loss. These collectors are used more frequently for U.S. commercial applications.
Solar water heating systems almost always require a backup system for cloudy days an

d times of increased demand. Conventional storage water heaters usually provide backup and may already be part of the solar system package. A backup system may also be part of the solar collector, such as rooftop tanks with thermosyphon systems. Since an integral-collector storage system already stores hot water in addition to collecting solar heat, it may be packaged with a tankless or demand-type water heater for backup.

Before buying a demand water heater, you also need to consider the following:

Size
Fuel type and availability
Energy efficiency (energy factor)
Costs

--- /home/ritik/Documents/VScode/Softmaxai/Frank_Solar_Project/Knowledge_Base/Tankless_or_Demand_Type_WH/Tankless_WH_Mechanics.txt ---
Tankless water heaters heat water instantaneously without the use of a storage tank. When a hot water faucet is turned on, cold water flows through a heat exchanger in the unit, and either a natural gas burner or an electric element heats the water.

As a result, tankless water heaters deliver a constant supply of hot water. You don't need to wait for a storage tank to fill up with enough hot water. However, a tankless water heater's output limits the flow rate.

Typically, tankless water heaters provide hot water at a rate of 2–5 gallons (7.6–15.2 liters) per minute. Gas-fired tankless water heaters produce higher flow rates than electric ones.

Sometimes, however, even the largest, gas-fired model cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous, multiple uses in large households. For example, taking a shower and running the dishwasher at the same time can stretch a tankless water heater to its limit.

To overcome this problem, you can install two or more tankless water heaters. You can also install separate tankless water heaters for appliances -- such as a clothes washer or dishwater -- that use a lot of hot water in your home. However, additional water heaters will cost more and may not be worth the additional cost.

Other applications for demand water heaters include the following:

Remote bathrooms or hot tubs
Booster for appliances, such as dishwashers or clothes washers
Booster for a solar water heating system.


--- /home/ritik/Documents/VScode/Softmaxai/Frank_Solar_Project/Knowledge_Base/Tankless_or_Demand_Type_WH/Tankless_WH_Pros_Cons.txt ---
For homes that use 41 gallons or less of hot water daily, demand water heaters can be 24%–34% more energy efficient than conventional storage tank water heaters. They can be 8%–14% more energy efficient for homes that use a lot of hot water -- around 86 gallons per day. In some cases you may be able to achieve even greater energy savings if you install a demand water heater at each hot water outlet. 

The initial cost of a tankless water heater is greater than that of a conventional storage water heater, but tankless water heaters will typically last longer and have lower operating and energy costs, which could offset their higher purchase price. Most tankless water heaters have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. They also have easily replaceable parts that may extend their life by many more years. In contrast, storage water heaters last 10–15 years.

Tankless water heaters avoid the standby heat losses associated with storage water heaters. However, although gas-fired tankless water heaters tend to have higher flow rates than electric ones, they can waste energy if they have a pilot light. This can sometimes offset the elimination of standby energy losses when compared to a storage water heater. In a gas-fired storage water heater, the pilot light heats the water in the tank so the energy isn't wasted.

The cost of operating a pilot light in a tankless water heater varies from model to model. Review the manufacturer's literature to determine how much gas the pilot light uses for the model you're considering. Look for models that have an intermittent ignition device (IID) instead of a standing pilot light. This device resembles the spark ignition device on some natural gas furnaces and kitchen ranges and ovens.

Heat pump water heater systems typically have higher initial costs than conventional storage water heaters. However, they typically have lower operating costs, which can offset higher purchase and installation costs. The Heat Pump Water Heater Installation Tool can guide you through the decision-making process for selecting a heat pump water heater and installing it properly.

Before buying a heat pump water heating system, you also need to consider the following:

Size and first-hour rating
Energy efficiency
If you're considering installing an integrated water heating, space heating, and cooling heat pump system in your home, see our information about air-source heat pumps and geothermal heat pumps.

--- /home/ritik/Documents/VScode/Softmaxai/Frank_Solar_Project/Knowledge_Base/Heat_Pump_Water_Heaters/How_Heat_Pump_Water_HW.txt ---
Heat pump water heaters use electricity to move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly. Therefore, they can be two to three times more energy efficient than conventional electric resistance water heaters. To move the heat, heat pumps work like a refrigerator in reverse.

Image related to Heat Pump Water Heaters
While a refrigerator pulls heat from inside a box and sends it into the surrounding room, a stand-alone air-source heat pump water heater pulls heat from the surrounding air and transfers it -- at a higher temperature -- to heat water in a storage tank. You can purchase a stand-alone heat pump water heating system as an integrated unit with a built-in water storage tank and back-up resistance heating elements. You can also retrofit a heat pump to work with an existing conventional storage water heater.

Heat pump water heaters require installation in locations that remain in the 40º–90ºF (4.4º–32.2ºC) range year-round and provide at least 1,000 cubic feet (28.3 cubic meters) of air space around the water heater. Air passing over the evaporator can be exhausted to the room or outdoors.

Heat pump water heaters will not operate efficiently in a cold space since they tend to cool the space they are in.  Installing them in a space with excess heat, such as a furnace room, will increase their efficiency.

You can also install an air-source heat pump system that combines heating, cooling, and water heating. These combination systems pull their heat indoors from the outside air in the winter and from the inside air in the summer. Because they remove heat from the air, any type of air-source heat pump system works more efficiently in a warm climate.

Homeowners primarily install geothermal heat pumps -- which draw heat from the ground during the winter and from the indoor air during the summer -- for heating and cooling their homes. For water heating, you can add a desuperheater to a geothermal heat pump system. A desuperheater is a small, auxiliary heat exchanger that uses superheated gases from the heat pump's compressor to heat water. This hot water then circulates through a pipe to the storage water heater tank in the house.

Desuperheaters are also available for tankless or demand-type water heaters. In the summer, the desuperheater uses the excess heat that would otherwise be expelled to the ground. With frequent operation during the summer, the geothermal heat pump may provide the majority of your hot water needs.  

During the fall, winter, and spring -- when the desuperheater isn't producing as much excess heat -- you'll need to rely more on your storage or demand water heater. Some manufacturers also offer triple-function geothermal heat pump systems, which provide heating, cooling, and hot water. They use a separate heat exchanger to meet all of a household's hot water needs.

Selection Criteria
When selecting a replacement water heater for your home, consider the following:

- Fuel type, availability and cost. The fuel type or energy source you use for water heating will not only affect the water heater's annual operation costs but also its size and energy efficiency. See below for more on selecting fuel types.

- Size. To provide your household with adequate hot water and maximize efficiency, you need a properly sized water heater. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on sizing.

- Energy efficiency. To maximize energy and cost savings, check the energy efficiency of a water heater before you purchase it. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating energy efficiency.

- Costs. Before you purchase a water heater, it's also a good idea to estimate the annual operating costs and compare those costs with other less or more energy-efficient models. Visit the pages on different types of water heaters (linked above) for more on estimating costs.

Also be sure to examine ways to reduce your hot water use, such as washing clothes in cold water. You may also want to explore other options such as drain-water heat recovery to save money on your water heating bill.

When selecting a new water heater, it's important to consider what fuel type or energy source you will use, including its availability and cost. The fuel used by a water heating system will not only affect annual operation costs but also the water heater's size and energy efficiency.

Exploring Water Heater Options by Fuel Type
Fuel type and its availability in your area may narrow your water heater choices. The following is a list of water heater options by fuel or energy source:


- Electricity : Widely available in the United States for conventional storage, tankless or demand-type, and heat pump water heaters. It also can be used with combination water and space heating systems, which include tankless coil and indirect water heaters.

- Fuel oil : Available in some areas of the United States to fuel conventional storage water heaters, and indirect combination water and space heating systems.

- Geothermal energy : Available throughout the United States to those who will have or already have a geothermal heat pump system installed in their homes for space heating and cooling. See Heat Pump Water Heaters for more information.

- Natural gas : Available in many areas of the United States to fuel conventional storage and demand (tankless or instantaneous) water heaters, as well as combination water and space heating systems, which include tankless coil and indirect water heaters.

- Propane : Available in many areas of the United States to fuel conventional storage and demand (tankless or instantaneous) water heaters, as well as indirect combination water and space heating systems.

- Solar energy : Available throughout the United States -- most abundantly in the Southwest -- for solar water heaters.

If you have more than one fuel type available in your area, it's a good idea to compare fuel costs, especially if you're building a new home. Even if you're replacing a water heater, you may find that you'll save more money in the long run if you use a different fuel or energy source.

However, if you are converting from one fuel type to another, there are other cost considerations, such as adding a breaker or running a gas line to the water heater and venting it outside. Contact your utility for current fuel costs or rates.

The type of water heater you choose will also affect your water heating costs. One type of water heater may use a fuel type more efficiently than another type of water heater. For example, an electric heat pump water heater typically is more energy efficient than an electric conventional storage water heater.

Also, an electric heat pump water heater might have lower energy costs than a gas-fired conventional storage water heater, even though local natural gas costs might be lower than the electricity rates.

Types of Water Heaters
It's a good idea to know the different types of water heaters available before you purchase one:

- Conventional storage water heaters offer a ready reservoir (storage tank) of hot water which is adequate for everyday use. However, there are some instances, such as when more than one use for hot water is occurring or when there are guests in the home, increasing the requirements for hot water.

- Tankless or demand-type water heaters heat water directly without the use of a storage tank. This type of water heater is designed to provide an adequate supply of hot water without running out when adequately sized.

- Heat pump water heaters move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly for providing hot water, resulting in high efficiencies and significant cost savings.

- Solar water heaters use the sun's heat to provide hot water and also save money on energy bills.

- Tankless coil and indirect water heaters use a home's space heating system to heat water.

Tankless or demand-type water heaters are rated by the maximum temperature rise possible at a given flow rate. Therefore, to size a demand water heater, you need to determine the flow rate and the temperature rise you'll need for its application (whole house or a remote application, such as just a bathroom) in your home.

List the number of hot water devices you expect to use at any one time.
 
Add up their flow rates (gallons per minute). This is the desired flow rate you'll want for the demand water heater. For example, let's say you expect to simultaneously run a hot water faucet with a flow rate of 0.75 gallons (2.84 liters) per minute and a shower head with a flow rate of 2.5 gallons (9.46 liters) per minute.
 
If you don’t know the flow rate, estimate it by holding a pan or bucket under the faucet or shower head and measure the flow for a minute. The flow rate through the demand water heater should be at least 3.25 gallons (12.3 liters) per minute. To reduce flow rates, install low-flow water fixtures.
 
To determine temperature rise, subtract the incoming water temperature from the desired output temperature. Unless you know otherwise, assume that the incoming water temperature is 50ºF (10ºC).

You can also estimate the temperature by holding a thermometer under a cold-water faucet. For most uses, you'll want your water heated to 120ºF (49ºC). In this example, you'd need a demand water heater that produces a temperature rise of 70ºF (39ºC) for most uses.

For dishwashers without internal heaters and other such applications, you might want your water heated at 140ºF (60ºC). In that case, you'll need a temperature rise of 90ºF (50ºC). Be cautious of a water temperature of 140ºF because it increases the possibility of scalding.
Most demand water heaters are rated for a variety of inlet temperatures. Typically, a 70ºF (39ºC) water temperature rise is possible at a flow rate of 5 gallons per minute through gas-fired demand water heaters and 2 gallons per minute through electric ones. Faster flow rates or cooler inlet temperatures can sometimes reduce the water temperature at the most distant faucet.

Some types of tankless water heaters are thermostatically controlled; they can vary their output temperature according to the water flow rate and inlet temperature.

To properly size a storage water heater for your home -- including a heat pump water heater with a tank -- use the water heater's first hour rating. The first hour rating is the number of gallons of hot water the heater can supply per hour (starting with a tank full of hot water). It depends on the tank capacity, source of heat (burner or element), and the size of the burner or element.

The EnergyGuide label lists the first hour rating in the top left corner as "Capacity (first hour rating)." The Federal Trade Commission requires an EnergyGuide label on all new conventional storage water heaters but not on heat pump water heaters. Product literature from a manufacturer may also provide the first hour rating. Look for water heater models with a first hour rating that at least matches within your peak hour demand (the highest energy use during a single 1-hour period for your home).

To estimate your peak hour demand:

Determine what time of day (morning, noon, evening) you use the highest amount of hot water in your home. Keep in mind the number of people living in your home.
Use the worksheet below to estimate your maximum usage of hot water during this one-hour period of the day—this is your peak hour demand. Note: the worksheet does not estimate total daily hot water usage.
The worksheet example shows a total peak hour demand of 66 gallons. Therefore, this household would need a water heater model with a first hour rating of 66 gallons or more.

Sizing your solar water heating system basically involves determining the total collector area and the storage volume you'll need to meet 90%–100% of your household's hot water needs during the summer. Solar system contractors use worksheets and computer programs to help determine system requirements and collector sizing.

Collector Area
Contractors usually follow a guideline of around 20 square feet (2 square meters) of collector area for each of the first two family members. For every additional person, add 8 square feet (0.7 square meters) if you live in the U.S. Sun Belt area or 12–14 square feet if you live in the northern United States.

Storage Volume
A small (50- to 60-gallon) storage tank is usually sufficient for one to two three people. A medium (80-gallon) storage tank works well for three to four people. A large tank is appropriate for four to six people.

For active systems, the size of the solar storage tank increases with the size of the collector -- typically 1.5 gallons per square foot of collector. This helps prevent the system from overheating when the demand for hot water is low. In very warm, sunny climates, some experts suggest that the ratio should be increased to as much as 2 gallons of storage to 1 square foot of collector area.

Other Calculations
Additional calculations involved in sizing your solar water heating system include evaluating your building site's solar resource and determining the proper orientation and tilt of the solar collector. Visit the solar water heaters page for more on these calculations.

Proper installation and maintenance of your water heater can optimize its energy efficiency.

Proper installation depends on many factors. These factors include fuel type, climate, local building code requirements, and safety issues, especially concerning the combustion of gas- and oil-fired water heaters. Therefore, it's best to have a qualified plumbing and heating contractor install your storage water heater. Be sure to do the following when selecting a contractor:

Request cost estimates in writing
Ask for references
Check the company with your local Better Business Bureau
See if the company will obtain a local permit if necessary and understands local building codes, etc.
If you're determined to install it yourself, first consult the water heater's manufacturer. Manufacturers usually have the necessary installation and instruction manuals. Also, contact your city or town for information about obtaining a permit, if necessary, and about local water heater building codes.

Periodic water heater maintenance can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Read your owner's manual for specific maintenance recommendations.

Routine maintenance for storage water heaters, depending on what type/model you have, may include:

Flushing a quart of water from the storage tank every three months
Checking the temperature and pressure valve every six months
Inspecting the anode rod every three to four years.

A single-family storage water heater offers a ready reservoir -- from 20 to 80 gallons -- of hot water. It operates by releasing hot water from the top of the tank when you turn on the hot water tap. To replace that hot water, cold water enters the bottom of the tank through the dip tube where it is heated, ensuring that the tank is always full.

Conventional storage water heater fuel sources include natural gas, propane, fuel oil, and electricity. Learn more about fuel types available when selecting a new water heater.

Since water is heated in the tank until the thermostat setpoint temperature is reached, energy can be wasted even when a hot water tap isn't running due to standby heat losses, which result from the tank losing heat to the surrounding environment. Only tankless water heaters -- such as demand-type water heaters and tankless coil water heaters -- avoid standby heat losses. Some storage water heater models have heavily insulated tank, which significantly reduce standby heat losses and lower annual operating costs. Look for models with tanks that have a thermal resistance (R-Value) of R-24 and above to avoid adding an insulation blanket (electric water heaters only).

Gas and oil water heaters also have venting-related energy losses. Two types of water heaters -- a fan-assisted gas water heater and an atmospheric sealed-combustion water heater -- reduce these losses. Visit the Energy Basics site to learn more about how conventional storage water heaters work.

For low energy bills the best choice to consider are heat pump water heaters and solar water heaters. These water heaters are usually more expensive but they have significantly lower annual operating costs that result in short payback periods.

A heat pump water heater utilizes a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. Heat is drawn (typically the ambient air using a fan) towards the evaporator coil, where a low-pressure refrigerant (commonly R-134a) would absorb the heat and evaporate. Then, a compressor would increase the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant vapor. This vapor would circulate through the condenser coil, which would be built into the tank or wrapped around a water tank, heating the water inside. The refrigerant would then pass through the expansion valve, lowering its pressure and temperature. 

Compared to the other technologies, heat pump water heaters are considered to have the highest energy efficiency as well as having low operating costs, providing long-term energy savings. However, it is less-effective in handling high-demand usage, suffers from a high upfront cost, and are not ideal for cold environments (losing efficiency in cold weather below 40°F)

--- /home/ritik/Documents/VScode/Softmaxai/Frank_Solar_Project/Knowledge_Base/water_heater/Tank_Less_Water_Heater.txt ---
Tank-less water heaters are compact, wall-hung units that operate by supplying hot water on-demand. Once the flow sensor detects that the hot water valve is open, it sends signals to the control module that demand for hot water is needed. The control module would then start the heating process. If electric, cold water would flow through serpentine pipes with resistive heating coils. If natural gas, the control module would signal the fan to turn on, the gas valve to open, and the ignitor to light the burner. The cold water would then circulate through a serpentine heat exchanger, absorbing heat from the exhaust gases. 

Tank-less water heaters can also be equipped with a condensing unit, where the water would flow through a secondary heat exchanger. In this process, additional heat would be extracted from exhaust gases. Condensate may also be produced from the cooling of the exhaust gases, which would be drained and neutralized.

Once the water exits the heating process, the hot water would flow to the hot water valve. In addition, a temperature sensor would measure the water temperature, alerting the control module to adjust the gas valve to reach the desired temperature.

Tank-less water heaters do not take up much space and can provide hot water without any potential waiting time. These systems are also relatively energy efficient. However, there is a high upfront cost to purchase and install this system. In addition, these systems may struggle to meet the demands of simultaneous multi-point usage.

Tank water heaters utilize a large, insulated tank to store hot water. Initially, cold water would enter the bottom of the tank via the dip tube that’s connected to the cold-water valve. The cold water would then be heated based on the fuel supply of the water heater. If electric, one or two resistive heating coils would be utilized, each with their own thermostat. A natural gas water heater would use a burner located at the bottom of the tank. This burner system would also include a thermocouple (measuring the temperature of the flame), control valve, and gas supply shutoff. As the natural gas combusts, the exhaust gases would flow through the flue, typically passing the draft hood/diverter which passively avoids backdrafts stabilizes the conditions of both the combustion and the flue draft.  

Another option for the draft diverter would be a power vent, which utilizes an electric fan to actively push the exhaust gases through the flue. While the power vent has a higher initial and operational cost, it does improve safety and provide higher efficiency compared to a draft diverter. In addition, natural gas water heaters can also be equipped with a condensing unit, extracting additional heat from exhaust gases. This condensing unit flows the flue gases through a heat exchanger which is either built into the tank or wrapped around the tank, transferring heat to the water in the tank. If some cases, the exhaust gases are cooled to the point where it condenses into its liquid state, in which the condensate would be drained and neutralized.

As mentioned previously, both the thermostat and thermocouple are used to monitor temperature. If the temperature falls below the setpoint (typically 120°F to 140°F), the monitors will send signals to the heater to activate. As the water is heated, hot water would flow to the top of the tank due to natural convention (raising temperature results in reduced density). The hot water would then exit the tank via the outlet pipe located near the top of the tank. 

Safety measures are also commonly included within the tank water heaters. A temperature and pressure relief valve works by opening when the tank reaches a temperature of more than 210°F or a pressure of more than 120 psi. An anode rod is submerged in the water, acting as a sacrificial element to protect the steel lining and prevent corrosion. Through galvanic corrosion, the anode rod would attract corrosive particles in the water, since the rod is made from a less noble metal compared to steel.

While the tank water heater is relatively simple and has a low upfront cost compared to the other technologies, there are also some challenges associated with the technology. When there is no water demand (on standby), heat would be lost. Once the tank is empty, the consumer would need to wait until the water is reheated. In addition, the tank water heater also has a considerable large physical footprint, requiring carful planning from the consumer.

UEF ratings are determined by assigning water heaters into one of four different categories of hot water usage and then evaluating their performance based on that usage. These categories are called bins. A water heater is assigned a UEF within its bin based upon its first hour rating. A higher UEF means a water heater is more energy efficient and will cost less to operate compared to other water heaters in the same bin. A water heater’s UEF can only be compared with water heaters within the same bin.

The higher the uniform energy factor, the more efficient the water heater. However, higher energy factor values don't always mean lower annual operating costs, especially when you compare fuel sources.

Product literature from a manufacturer usually provides a water heater model's energy factor. Don't choose a water heater model based solely on its energy factor. When selecting a water heater, it's also important to consider size and first hour rating, fuel type, and overall cost.

BIN,BIN Daily Usage (Gallons), First Hour Rating (Tank-Type Water Heaters), Max GPM (Tankless Water Heaters)
Very Small, 10,Less than 18 gallons, Less than 1.7
Low, 38, 18 to 51 gallons, 1.7 to 2.8
Medium, 55,51 to 75 gallons, 2.8 to 4
High, 84 ,75 gallons or larger ,4 or more

A water heater's energy efficiency is determined by the uniform energy factor (UEF), which is based on how much energy the water heater uses and how much energy is used to power the water heater itself.  The higher the uniform energy factor, the more efficient the water heater.  

Estimates of a home water heater's energy efficiency and annual operating cost are shown on the yellow Energy Guide label.  You can then compare costs with other models. This will help you determine the dollar savings and payback period of investing in a more efficient model, which may have a higher purchase price.

A tankless coil water heater provides hot water on demand without a tank. When a hot water faucet is turned on, water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger installed in a main furnace or boiler. Tankless coil water heaters are most efficient during cold months when the heating system is used regularly but can be an inefficient choice for many homes, especially for those in warmer climates. Tankless systems are typically electric, oil, or gas-fired. These water heating systems work with forced air systems and hydronic or radiant floor heating systems.

Indirect water heaters are a more efficient choice for most homes, even though they require a storage tank. An indirect water heater uses the main furnace or boiler to heat a fluid that's circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank. An indirect water heater, if used with a high-efficiency boiler and well-insulated tank, can be the least expensive means of providing hot water, particularly if the heat source boiler is set to "cold start."

Indirect water heaters are a more efficient choice for most homes, even though they require a storage tank. An indirect water heater uses the main furnace or boiler to heat a fluid that's circulated through a heat exchanger in the storage tank. The energy stored by the water tank allows the furnace to turn off and on less often, which saves energy. An indirect water heater, if used with a high-efficiency boiler and well-insulated tank, can be the least expensive means of providing hot water, particularly if the heat source boiler is set to "cold start."

Indirect systems can be fired by gas, oil, propane, electric, solar energy, or a combination of any of these.

Proper installation and maintenance of a combination water and space heating system can optimize its energy efficiency.

Proper installation of your system depends on many factors. These factors include fuel type, climate, local building code requirements, and safety issues. Therefore, it's best to have a qualified plumbing and heating contractor handle the installation. Be sure to do the following when selecting a contractor:

Request cost estimates in writing
Ask for references
Check the company with your local Better Business Bureau
See if the company will obtain a local permit if necessary and understands local building codes, etc.
Periodic maintenance of your system can significantly extend your water heater's life and minimize loss of efficiency. Consult your installer and read your owner's manual for specific maintenance recommendations.

Integrated or combination water and space heating systems usually cost more than a separate water heater and furnace or boiler, but installation and maintenance costs may be less. For example, you won't need multiple utility hook-ups since there's one source of heat. There also aren't as many moving parts to maintain or service. Some of these high efficiency systems may provide lower utility costs.

Most combination water and space heating systems are usually designed for new construction. However, there are some retrofit units available that can work with an existing water heater.

When selecting a system, you need to consider its size. The sizing of a combination system involves some different calculations than those used for sizing a separate water heating or space heating system. It's best left to a qualified plumbing and heating contractor.

To determine the energy efficiency of a combination water and space heating system, use its combined appliance efficiency rating (CAE). The higher the number, the more energy efficient. Combination appliance efficiency ratings vary from 0.59 to 0.90.
