1. Solar Water Heaters

How They Work
- Include storage tanks and solar collectors
- Two types: active (with circulating pumps and controls) and passive (without)

Active Solar Water Heating Systems
- Direct circulation systems: Pumps circulate household water through collectors - work well where it rarely freezes
- Indirect circulation systems: Pumps circulate non-freezing heat-transfer fluid through collectors and heat exchanger - popular in freeze-prone climates

Passive Solar Water Heating Systems
- Less expensive than active systems but usually less efficient
- More reliable and may last longer
- Integral collector-storage systems: Storage tank covered with transparent material, works best where temperatures rarely fall below freezing
- Thermosyphon systems: Water heated in roof collector, flows through plumbing when faucet opened, typically 40-gallon capacity

Storage Tanks and Solar Collectors
- Most require well-insulated storage tank with additional outlet/inlet for collector
- Two-tank systems: Solar preheats water before conventional heater
- One-tank systems: Backup heater combined with solar storage

Three collector types:
- Flat-plate collector: Glazed (insulated weatherproofed boxes with dark absorber plate under glass/plastic covers) or unglazed (for pool heating)
- Integral collector-storage (ICS/batch systems): Black tanks/tubes in insulated glazed box, install only in mild-freeze climates
- Evacuated-tube collectors: Parallel rows of glass tubes with metal absorber tubes, used more in commercial applications

Selecting a Solar Water Heater
Before purchase:
- Estimate cost and energy efficiency
- Evaluate site's solar resource
- Determine correct system size
- Investigate local codes and regulations
- Understand heat exchangers and heat-transfer fluids

Installing and Maintaining
- Best to use qualified solar thermal contractor due to complexity
- Passive systems need minimal maintenance
- Active systems require discussion with provider about maintenance
- Glazing may need cleaning in dry climates
- Regular maintenance every 3-5 years for simple systems
- Systems with electrical components may need parts replaced after 10 years

Sizing Solar Water Heating Systems
- Collector Area: ~20 sq ft for first two family members, +8 sq ft each additional person (Sun Belt) or +12-14 sq ft (northern US)
- Storage Volume: 50-60 gallons (1-2 people), 80 gallons (3-4 people), large tank (4-6 people)
- Active systems: 1.5 gallons per sq ft of collector, up to 2 gallons in very warm climates

Improving Energy Efficiency
- Try additional energy-saving strategies after proper installation
- Some devices more cost-effective when installed with water heater

2. Tankless/Demand-Type Water Heaters

Mechanics
- Heat water instantaneously without storage tank
- When hot water faucet turned on, cold water flows through heat exchanger
- Natural gas burner or electric element heats water
- Deliver constant supply at 2-5 gallons per minute (gas higher than electric)
- Large households may need multiple units for simultaneous use

Pros and Cons
- Efficiency: 24-34% more efficient for homes using ≤41 gallons/day, 8-14% more for ~86 gallons/day
- Costs: Higher initial cost but longer life (20+ years vs 10-15 for storage), lower operating costs
- Drawbacks: Gas models may waste energy with pilot light (look for intermittent ignition device)

Installation
- Professional installation recommended due to complexity
- Select contractor with written estimates, references, Better Business Bureau check
- Periodic maintenance significantly extends life

Selecting Demand Water Heaters
Consider:
- Size and flow rate requirements
- Fuel type and availability
- Energy efficiency (energy factor)
- Costs

Sizing Tankless Water Heaters
1. List hot water devices expected to use simultaneously
2. Add up flow rates (gallons per minute) - this is desired flow rate
3. Determine temperature rise: subtract incoming water temperature (assume 50°F) from desired output (typically 120°F, 140°F for dishwashers)
4. Most demand heaters rated for 70°F rise at 5 GPM (gas) or 2 GPM (electric)

Improving Energy Efficiency
- Additional energy-saving strategies after proper installation
- Some devices more cost-effective when installed with water heater

3. Heat Pump Water Heaters

How They Work
- Use electricity to move heat rather than generate it directly
- 2-3 times more efficient than conventional electric resistance heaters
- Work like refrigerator in reverse
- Pull heat from surrounding air, transfer at higher temperature to heat water
- Require 40-90°F ambient temperature and 1,000+ cubic feet air space
- Cool the space they're in, work better in spaces with excess heat

Types:
- Stand-alone air-source: Integrated unit with built-in tank and backup elements
- Retrofit: Can work with existing conventional tank
- Combination systems: Heating, cooling, and water heating
- Geothermal with desuperheater: Uses superheated gases from heat pump compressor

Selecting Heat Pump Water Heaters
- Higher initial costs but lower operating costs
- Consider size, first-hour rating, and energy efficiency
- Heat Pump Water Heater Installation Tool available for guidance

Installation and Maintenance
- Professional installation recommended
- Select qualified contractor with written estimates, references, Better Business Bureau check
- Periodic maintenance extends life and minimizes efficiency loss

Improving Energy Efficiency
- Additional energy-saving strategies after proper installation
- Some devices more cost-effective when installed with water heater

4. Storage Water Heaters

How They Work
- Ready reservoir of 20-80 gallons hot water
- Hot water released from top, cold enters bottom through dip tube
- Fuel sources: natural gas, propane, fuel oil, electricity
- Energy waste from standby heat losses
- Gas/oil models have venting-related losses
- Look for R-24+ insulation to reduce standby losses

Selecting Storage Water Heaters
- Don't choose cheapest - consider lifetime costs
- Avoid oversizing (higher costs, more standby losses)
- Consider size, first-hour rating, fuel type, energy efficiency, costs

Installation and Maintenance
- Professional installation recommended for safety and code compliance
- Select contractor with written estimates, references, Better Business Bureau check
- Routine maintenance: Flush quart of water every 3 months, check T&P valve every 6 months, inspect anode rod every 3-4 years

Improving Energy Efficiency
- Additional energy-saving strategies after proper installation
- Some devices more cost-effective when installed with water heater

5. Tankless Coil and Indirect Water Heaters

Tankless Coil Water Heaters
- Provide hot water on demand without tank
- Water heated as it flows through coil/heat exchanger in main furnace/boiler
- Most efficient during cold months when heating system used regularly
- Can be inefficient in warmer climates
- Work with forced air and hydronic/radiant floor systems

Indirect Water Heaters
- More efficient choice for most homes despite requiring storage tank
- Use main furnace/boiler to heat fluid circulated through heat exchanger in storage tank
- Energy stored by tank allows furnace to cycle less frequently
- Can be least expensive means of providing hot water with high-efficiency boiler
- Can be fired by gas, oil, propane, electric, solar, or combinations

Combination Water and Space Heating
- Usually cost more than separate systems but lower installation/maintenance costs
- Fewer utility connections and moving parts
- Most designed for new construction, some retrofit units available
- Use Combined Appliance Efficiency (CAE) rating: 0.59-0.90, higher is better

Installation and Maintenance
- Professional installation recommended
- Select contractor with written estimates, references, Better Business Bureau check
- Periodic maintenance extends life and minimizes efficiency loss

Improving Energy Efficiency
- Additional energy-saving strategies for both water heating and space heating/cooling
